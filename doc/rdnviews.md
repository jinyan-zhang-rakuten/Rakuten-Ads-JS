# Quick guide for RDN Viewability Tag

RUNA vw.js is a sub-component for measuring viewability of target HTML element.

## Usage
Here is the basic format for measuring viewability of the `div` element. `viewable` here means 50% of the ad's pixels are visible in the browser window for a continuous 1 second.

#### Install vw.js
please paste the following `<script>` tag to `<head>` tag basically.

- For Staging.

```html
<script src="https://stg-s-cdn.rmp.rakuten.co.jp/js/vw.js" async></script>
```

- For Production.

```html
<script src="https://s-cdn.rmp.rakuten.co.jp/js/vw.js" async></script>
```

#### Example1:
When `vw.js` is loaded after tag, the below pattern works. 
However if only one tag is called, and running not asynchronously,`vw.js` can be loaded before tag. Because rdnviews variable is monitored and monitoring stops after value detected in rdnviews variable once.
```html
<div id="viewability-test-div"
  style="background-color:black;width:300px;height:250px;">
</div>
<script>
  window.rdnviews = window.rdnviews || [];
  window.rdnviews.push({
    el: document.getElementById('viewability-test-div'),
    measuredURL: 'https://example.com/measured',
    inviewURL: 'https://example.com/inview',
  });
</script>
```

#### Example2:
When `vw.js` is loaded before tag, `rdnviewMount` function can be called.
And this pattern is expected when multiple tags are created asynchronously.

```html
<div id="viewability-test-div"
  style="background-color:black;width:300px;height:250px;">
</div>
<script>
  window.rdnviewMount(document.getElementById('viewability-test-div'), {
    measuredURL: 'https://example.com/measured',
    inviewURL: 'https://example.com/inview',
  });
</script>
```

#### parameters
- `el` (required) is the element instance to be measured.
- `measuredURL` (optional) is an endpoint to log if the element is measurable or not. For some scenarios, `vw.js` can not measure the viewability of an ad, so it wouldn't send request to `measuredURL`.The response of it should be an image beacon which return a 1x1 gif image.
- `inviewURL` (required) is an endpoint to log if the element viewed or not. It'll only be triggered when the element is *measurable* and *got viewed*. The response of it should also be an image beacon.
